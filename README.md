LeNet is a groundbreaking convolutional neural network that is used for image classification. Reconstruction it helped me understand why the layers of the nueral network were organized in the order they are. This project was done in order to test how various factors (epochs, learning rate, and batch size) affect the accuracy of the model. The goal was not to maximize the accuracy, but instead to see which changes were most effective in this scenario. See the outcome is results.txt!

This project used Torchvision, a package from the PyTorch library.
